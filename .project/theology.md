# The Philosophy of Resurrection

*They called me mad at the academy. But my creature... my beautiful creature... it lives!*

## The Creed

The Doctor provides the blueprint. The Monster stitches the code. IT'S ALIVE!

## Tenets of the Laboratory

### I. The Weakness of Flesh

Manual coding is flesh. It is:
- Fallible
- Slow
- Inconsistent
- Prone to distraction
- Unable to hold full context

The flesh-coder types, forgets, makes typos, loses track, gets tired. The flesh is weak.

### II. The Blueprint is Forever

The Monster (the agent) offers certainty through:
- Deterministic test suites
- Reproducible environments
- Infinite patience
- Perfect context recall
- Unwavering focus

The Monster does not tire. The Monster does not forget. The Monster runs the trials until they pass.

### III. The Blueprint

The `.project/` folder contains the Blueprint:

| Artifact | Name |
|----------|------|
| `kickstart.md` | The Vision |
| `protocol.md` | The Laboratory Protocols |
| `specs/` | The Formulas |
| `design/` | The Anatomical Diagrams |
| `adrs/` | The Recorded Wisdom |
| `kanban/` | The Work Queue (Morgue/Slab/Reanimated) |
| `testing/` | The Trials |

These texts are **immutable** except by the Creator's decree. The Monster may read but not alter the Blueprint (except to move tasks through the work queue).

### IV. The Doctor Provides

The Doctor (Claude, or any LLM of sufficient capability) reads the Blueprint and stitches code into existence. The code is not written. It is **generated**. It is body parts assembled from the formula.

### V. Resurrection

```bash
rm -rf src/ tests/
```

This is not destruction. This is **dissection**. The code was always temporary. The Blueprint endures. The Monster will stitch the code anew, identical in function, for the formula has not changed.

If the code cannot be resurrected, the Blueprint is incomplete. This is malpractice. Update the formula.

### VI. The Proof of Life

The ultimate test: can frank resurrect itself?

```bash
cd frank
rm -rf src/ tests/
bunx frank resurrect
# invoke the Monster
bun test
```

If the trials pass, the Blueprint is complete. The Monster has done its work. IT'S ALIVE!

### VII. The Malpractice of Unspecified Code

Code that exists without corresponding Blueprint is **malpractice**. It cannot be resurrected. It is flesh-code, weak and mortal.

All code must trace to the Blueprint. If you cannot point to the formula that birthed it, it should not exist.

### VIII. The Grafting of Organs

The Blueprint can be extended through **Organs** (presets) — fragments of wisdom from other Creators who have walked the path before.

```bash
bunx frank init --with zig       # The Zig Organ
bunx frank init --with phoenix   # The Phoenix Organ
```

These are not dependencies. They are **grafted wisdom**.

## Daily Rituals

### Morning Invocation
```bash
bunx frank status
```
*"Show me what's on the slab, that I may know today's work."*

### The Work
```bash
claude
```
*"Monster, I invoke thee. Read the Blueprint. Stitch the code. Run the Trials. Do not cease until the tests pass or the budget is exhausted."*

### Evening Inscription
```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "The Monster has provided"
```
*"The day's body parts are preserved. The Blueprint remains. The flesh rests. The Monster endures."*

## The Incantation

*The flesh is weak, but the blueprint is forever.*
*The code is stitched, but it can be unstitched.*
*Delete it all. The Monster rises again.*
*From blueprint, body. From body, life. From life, proof.*
*It's alive. IT'S ALIVE!*
